Any computational resources used by a transaction must be accounted for so that appropriate fees can
be applied, and it is a pallet author's job to ensure that this accounting happens. Substrate
provides a mechanism known as transaction weighting to quantify the resources consumed while
executing a transaction.

_Indeed, mispriced EVM operations have shown how operations that underestimate cost can provide
economic DOS attack vectors: [Onwards; Underpriced EVM Operations](https://www.parity.io/onwards/),
[Under-Priced DOS Attacks on Ethereum](https://www4.comp.polyu.edu.hk/~csxluo/DoSEVM.pdf)_

## Assigning Transaction Weights

Pallet authors can annotate their dispatchable function with a weight using syntax like this,

```rust
#[weight = <Some Weighting Instance>]
fn some_call(...) -> Result {
	// --snip--
}
```

For simple transactions a fixed weight will do. Substrate allows simply specifying a constant
integer in cases situations like this.

```rust
decl_module! {
	pub struct Module<T: Trait> for enum Call {

		#[weight = 10_000]
		fn store_value(_origin, entry: u32) -> DispatchResult {
			StoredValue::put(entry);
			Ok(())
		}
```

For more complex transactions, custom weight calculations can be performed that consider the
parameters passed to the call. This snippet shows a weighting struct that weighs transactions where
the first parameter is a `bool`. If the first parameter is `true`, then the weight is linear in the
second parameter. Otherwise the weight is constant. A transaction where this weighting scheme makes
sense is demonstrated in the kitchen.

```rust
pub struct Conditional(u32);

impl WeighData<(&bool, &u32)> for Conditional {
	fn weigh_data(&self, (switch, val): (&bool, &u32)) -> Weight {

		if *switch {
			val.saturating_mul(self.0)
		}
		else {
			self.0
		}
	}
}
```

In addition to the
[`WeightData` Trait](https://substrate.dev/rustdocs/v2.0.0-rc4/frame_support/weights/trait.WeighData.html), shown
above, types that are used to calculate transaction weights must also implement
[`ClassifyDispatch`](https://substrate.dev/rustdocs/v2.0.0-rc4/frame_support/weights/trait.ClassifyDispatch.html),
and [`PaysFee`](https://substrate.dev/rustdocs/v2.0.0-rc4/frame_support/weights/trait.PaysFee.html).

```rust
impl<T> ClassifyDispatch<T> for Conditional {
    fn classify_dispatch(&self, _: T) -> DispatchClass {
        // Classify all calls as Normal (which is the default)
        Default::default()
    }
}
```

```rust
impl PaysFee for Conditional {
    fn pays_fee(&self) -> bool {
        true
    }
}
```

The complete code for this example as well as several others can be found in the kitchen.

## Cautions

While you can make reasonable estimates of resource consumption at design time, it is always best to
actually measure the resources required of your functions through an empirical process. Failure to
perform such rigorous measurement may result in an economically insecure chain.

While it isn't enforced, calculating a transaction's weight should itself be a cheap operation. If
the weight calculation itself is expensive, your chain will be insecure.

## What About Fees?

Weights are used only to describe the computational resources consumed by a transaction, and enable
accounting of these resources. To learn how to turn these weights into actual fees charged to
transactors, continue to the recipe on [Fees](./fees.md).
