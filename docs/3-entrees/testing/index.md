# Testing

Although the Rust compiler ensures safe memory management, it cannot formally verify the correctness
of a program's logic. Fortunately, Rust also comes with great libraries and documentation for
writing unit and integration tests. When you initiate code with Cargo, test scaffolding is
automatically generated to simplify the developer experience. Basic testing concepts and syntax are
covered in depth in
[Chapter 11 of the Rust Book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch11-00-testing.html).

-   [Basic Test Environments](./mock.md)
-   [Common Tests](./common.md)
-   [Off-chain Worker Test Environment](./off-chain-workers.md)
-   [Custom Test Environment](./externalities.md)

There's also more rigorous testing systems ranging from mocking and fuzzing to formal verification.
See [quickcheck](https://docs.rs/quickcheck/0.9.0/quickcheck/) for an example of a property-based
testing framework ported from Haskell to Rust.

## Kitchen Pallets with Unit Tests

The following modules in the kitchen have partial unit test coverage

-   [`adding-machine`](https://github.com/substrate-developer-hub/recipes/tree/master/pallets/adding-machine)
-   [`constant-config`](https://github.com/substrate-developer-hub/recipes/tree/master/pallets/constant-config)
-   [`double-map`](https://github.com/substrate-developer-hub/recipes/tree/master/pallets/double-map)
-   [`generic-event`](https://github.com/substrate-developer-hub/recipes/tree/master/pallets/generic-event)
-   [`offchain-demo`](https://github.com/substrate-developer-hub/recipes/tree/master/pallets/offchain-demo)
-   [`simple-event`](https://github.com/substrate-developer-hub/recipes/tree/master/pallets/simple-event)
-   [`simple-map`](https://github.com/substrate-developer-hub/recipes/tree/master/pallets/simple-map)
-   [`single-value`](https://github.com/substrate-developer-hub/recipes/tree/master/pallets/single-value)
-   [`storage-cache`](https://github.com/substrate-developer-hub/recipes/tree/master/pallets/storage-cache)
-   [`struct-storage`](https://github.com/substrate-developer-hub/recipes/tree/master/pallets/struct-storage)
-   [`vec-set`](https://github.com/substrate-developer-hub/recipes/tree/master/pallets/vec-set)

### Cooking in the Kitchen (Running Tests)

To run the tests, clone the repo

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/substrate-developer-hub/recipes
```

Enter the path to the pallet to be tested

```bash
$ cd pallets/<some-module>
```

For example, to test `constant-config`, used in
[Configurable Constants](https://substrate.dev/recipes/3-entrees/constants.html),

```bash
$ cd pallets/constant-config/
$ cargo test
```

Writing unit tests is one of the best ways to understand the code. Although unit tests are not
comprehensive, they provide a first check to verify that the programmer's basic invariants are not
violated in the presence of obvious, expected state changes.
