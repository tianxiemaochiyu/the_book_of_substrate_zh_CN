# Mock Runtime for Unit Testing

_See [Testing](./index.md) page for list of kitchen pallets with unit test coverage._

There are two main patterns on writing tests for pallets. We can put the tests:

1. At the bottom of the pallet, place unit tests in a separate Rust module with a special
   compilation attribute:

    ```rust
    #[cfg(test)]
    mod tests {
    	// -- snip --
    }
    ```

2. In a separate file called `tests.rs` inside `src` folder, and conditionally include tests inside
   the main `lib.rs`. At the top of the `lib.rs`

    ```rust
    #[cfg(test)]
    mod tests;
    ```

Now, to use the logic from the pallet under test, bring `Module` and `Trait` into scope.

```rust
use crate::{Module, Trait};
```

## Create the Outer Environment for Mock Runtime

Before we create the mock runtime that take our pallet to run tests, we first need to create the
outer environment for the runtime as follows:

```rust
use support::{impl_outer_event, impl_outer_origin, parameter_types};
use runtime_primitives::{Perbill, traits::{IdentityLookup, BlakeTwo256}, testing::Header};
use runtime_io;
use primitives::{H256};

// We define the outer `Origin` enum and `Event` enum.
// You may not be aware that these enums are created when writing the runtime/pallet;
//   it is because they are created through the `construct_runtime!` macro.
// Also, these are not standard Rust but the syntax expected when parsed inside
//   these macros.
impl_outer_origin! {
	pub enum Origin for TestRuntime {}
}

// -- If you want to test events, add the following. Otherwise, please ignore --
mod test_events {
	pub use crate::Event;
}

impl_outer_event! {
	pub enum TestEvent for TestRuntime {
		test_events,
		system<T>,
	}
}
// -- End: Code setup for testing events --
```

## Define Mock Runtime and Implement Necessary Pallet Traits

Now, declare the mock runtime as a unit structure

```rust
#[derive(Clone, PartialEq, Eq, Debug)]
pub struct TestRuntime;
```

The `derive` macro attribute provides implementations of the `Clone`, `PartialEq`, `Eq`, `Debug`
traits for the `TestRuntime` struct.

The mock runtime also needs to implement the tested pallet's `Trait`. If it is unnecessary to test
the pallet's `Event` type, the type can be set to `()`. See further below to test the pallet's
`Event` enum.

```rust
impl Trait for TestRuntime {
	type Event = ();
}
```

Next, we create a new type that wraps the mock `TestRuntime` in the pallet's `Module`.

```rust
pub type TestPallet = Module<TestRuntime>;
```

It may be helpful to read this as type aliasing our configured mock runtime to work with the
pallet's `Module`, which is what is ultimately being tested.

In many cases, the pallet's `Trait` is further bound by `system::Trait` like:

```rust
pub trait Trait: system::Trait {
	type Event: From<Event<Self>> + Into<<Self as system::Trait>::Event>;
}
```

The mock runtime must inherit and define the `system::Trait` associated types. To do so, `impl` the
`system::Trait` for `TestRuntime` with types created previously and imported from other crates.

```rust
#[derive(Clone, PartialEq, Eq, Debug)]
pub struct TestRuntime;

parameter_types! {
	pub const BlockHashCount: u64 = 250;
	pub const MaximumBlockWeight: u32 = 1024;
	pub const MaximumBlockLength: u32 = 2 * 1024;
	pub const AvailableBlockRatio: Perbill = Perbill::one();
}

// First, implement the system pallet's configuration trait for `TestRuntime`
impl system::Trait for TestRuntime {
	type Origin = Origin;
	type Index = u64;
	type Call = ();
	type BlockNumber = u64;
	type Hash = H256;
	type Hashing = BlakeTwo256;
	type AccountId = u64;
	type Lookup = IdentityLookup<Self::AccountId>;
	type Header = Header;
	// To test events, use `TestEvent`. Otherwise, use the commented line
	type Event = TestEvent;
	// type Event = ();
	type BlockHashCount = BlockHashCount;
	type MaximumBlockWeight = MaximumBlockWeight;
	type MaximumBlockLength = MaximumBlockLength;
	type AvailableBlockRatio = AvailableBlockRatio;
	type Version = ();
	type ModuleToIndex = ();
	type AccountData = ();
	type OnNewAccount = ();
	type OnKilledAccount = ();
}

// Then implement our own pallet's configuration trait for `TestRuntime`
impl Trait for TestRuntime {
	type Event = TestEvent;
}

// Assign back to type variables so we can make dispatched calls of these modules later.
pub type System = system::Module<TestRuntime>;
pub type TestPallet = Module<TestRuntime>;
```

With this, it is possible to use this type in the unit tests. For example, the block number can be
set with
[`set_block_number`](https://substrate.dev/rustdocs/v2.0.0-rc4/frame_system/struct.Module.html#method.set_block_number)

```rust
#[test]
fn add_emits_correct_event() {
	// ExtBuilder syntax is explained further below
	ExtBuilder::build().execute_with(|| {
		System::set_block_number(2);
		// some assert statements and HelloSubstrate calls
	}
}
```

## Basic Test Environments

To build the test runtime environment, import `runtime_io`

```rust
use runtime_io;
```

In the `Cargo.toml`, this only needs to be imported under `dev-dependencies` since it is only used
in the `tests` module. It also doesn't need to be feature gated in the `std` feature.

```
[dev-dependencies.sp-io]
default-features = false

version = '2.0.0-alpha.7'
```

There is more than one pattern for building a mock runtime environment for testing pallet logic. Two
patterns are presented below. The latter is generally favored for reasons discussed in
[custom test environment](./externalities.md)

-   [`new_test_ext`](#newext) - consolidates all the logic for building the environment to a single
    public method, but isn't relatively configurable (i.e. uses one set of pallet constants)
-   [`ExtBuilder`](#extbuilder) - define methods on the unit struct `ExtBuilder` to facilitate a
    flexible environment for tests (i.e. can reconfigure pallet constants in every test if
    necessary)

## new_test_ext <a name = "newext"><a/>

_[`pallets/smpl-treasury`](https://github.com/substrate-developer-hub/recipes/tree/master/pallets/charity)_

In
[`smpl-treasury`](https://github.com/substrate-developer-hub/recipes/tree/master/pallets/charity),
use the `balances::GenesisConfig` and the pallet's `Genesis::<TestRuntime>` to set the balances of
the test accounts and establish council membership in the returned test environment.

```rust
pub fn new_test_ext() -> runtime_io::TestExternalities {
	let mut t = system::GenesisConfig::default().build_storage::<TestRuntime>().unwrap();
	balances::GenesisConfig::<TestRuntime> {
		balances: vec![
			// members of council (can also be users)
			(1, 13),
			(2, 11),
			(3, 1),
			(4, 3),
			(5, 19),
			(6, 23),
			(7, 17),
			// users, not members of council
			(8, 1),
			(9, 22),
			(10, 46),
		],
		vesting: vec![],
	}.assimilate_storage(&mut t).unwrap();
	GenesisConfig::<TestRuntime>{
		council: vec![
			1,
			2,
			3,
			4,
			5,
			6,
			7,
		]
	}.assimilate_storage(&mut t).unwrap();
	t.into()
}
```

More specifically, this sets the `AccountId`s in the range of `[1, 7]` inclusive as the members of
the `council`. This is expressed in the `decl_module` block with the addition of an
`add_extra_genesis` block,

```rust
add_extra_genesis {
	build(|config| {
		// ..other stuff..
		<Council<T>>::put(&config.council);
	});
}
```

To use `new_test_ext` in a runtime test, we call the method and call
[`execute_with`](https://substrate.dev/rustdocs/v2.0.0-rc4/sp_state_machine/struct.TestExternalities.html#method.execute_with)
on the returned `runtime_io::TestExternalities`

```rust
#[test]
fn fake_test() {
	new_test_ext().execute_with(|| {
		// test logic
	})
}
```

`execute_with` executes all logic expressed in the closure within the configured runtime test
environment specified in `new_test_ext`

## ExtBuilder <a name = "extbuilder"></a>

_[`pallets/struct-storage`](https://github.com/substrate-developer-hub/recipes/tree/master/pallets/struct-storage)_

Another approach providing for a more flexible runtime test environment, instantiates a unit struct
`ExtBuilder`,

```rust
pub struct ExtBuilder;
```

The behavior for constructing the test environment is contained the methods on the `ExtBuilder` unit
structure. This fosters multiple levels of configuration depending on if the test requires a common
default instance of the environment or a more specific edge case configuration. The latter is
explored in more detail in [Custom Test Environment](./externalities.md).

Like `new_test_ext`, the `build()` method on the `ExtBuilder` object returns an instance of
[`TestExternalities`](https://substrate.dev/rustdocs/v2.0.0-rc4/sp_state_machine/struct.TestExternalities.html).
[Externalities](https://substrate.dev/rustdocs/v2.0.0-rc4/sp_externalities/index.html) are an abstraction that allows
the runtime to access features of the outer node such as storage or offchain workers.

In this case, create a mock storage from the default genesis configuration.

```rust
impl ExtBuilder {
	pub fn build() -> runtime_io::TestExternalities {
		let mut storage = system::GenesisConfig::default().build_storage::<TestRuntime>().unwrap();
		runtime_io::TestExternalities::from(storage)
	}
}
```

which calls some methods to create a test environment,

```rust
#[test]
fn fake_test_example() {
	ExtBuilder::build().execute_with(|| {
		// ...test conditions...
	})
}
```

While testing in this environment, runtimes that require signed extrinsics (i.e. take `origin` as a
parameter) will require transactions coming from an `Origin`. This requires importing the
[`impl_outer_origin`](https://substrate.dev/rustdocs/v2.0.0-rc4/frame_support/macro.impl_outer_origin.html) macro
from `support`

```rust
use support::{impl_outer_origin};

impl_outer_origin!{
	pub enum Origin for TestRuntime {}
}
```

It is possible to place signed transactions as parameters in runtime methods that require the
`origin` input. See the
[full code in the kitchen](https://github.com/substrate-developer-hub/recipes/tree/master/pallets/hello-substrate),
but this looks like

```rust
#[test]
fn last_value_updates() {
	ExtBuilder::build().execute_with(|| {
		HelloSubstrate::set_value(Origin::signed(1), 10u64);
		// some assert statements
	})
}
```

Run these tests with `cargo test`, an optional parameter is the test's name to only run that test
and not all tests.

Note that the input to `Origin::signed` is the `system::Trait`'s `AccountId` type which was set to
`u64` for the `TestRuntime` implementation. In theory, this could be set to some other type as long
as it conforms to the
[trait bound](https://substrate.dev/rustdocs/v2.0.0-rc4/frame_system/trait.Trait.html#associatedtype.AccountId),

```rust
pub trait Trait: 'static + Eq + Clone {
	//...
	type AccountId: Parameter + Member + MaybeSerializeDeserialize + Debug + MaybeDisplay + Ord + Default;
	//...
}
```

### Setting for Testing Event Emittances

Events are not emitted on block 0. So when testing for whether events are emitted, we manually set
the block number in the test environment from 0 to 1 like so:

```rust
impl ExtBuilder {
	pub fn build() -> TestExternalities {
		let storage = system::GenesisConfig::default().build_storage::<TestRuntime>().unwrap();
		let mut ext = TestExternalities::from(storage);
		ext.execute_with(|| System::set_block_number(1));
		ext
	}
}
```
