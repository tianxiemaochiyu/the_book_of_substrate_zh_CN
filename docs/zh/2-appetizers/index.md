# Appetizers

This section of the cookbook will focus on Appetizers, small runtime pallets that teach you the
basics of writing pallets with a little hand-holding. If you are brand new to Substrate, you should
follow through these appetizers in order. If you've already got the basics of pallet development
down, you may skip ahead to the entrees which may be read in any order.

This section covers:

-   [Dispatchable Calls](./1-hello-substrate.md) - How users submit transactions
-   [Storage Values](./2-storage-values.md) - Storing the state of the blockchain
-   [Errors](./3-errors.md) - When things go wrong during a transaction
-   [Events](./4-events.md) - Notifying the offchain world of success
