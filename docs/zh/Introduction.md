# Substrate 食谱 🍴😋🍴

_有抱负的区块链厨师的动手食谱_

Substrate Recipes 是一本工作示例的食谱，展示了使用 **[Substrate](https://github.com/paritytech/substrate)** 构建区块链时的最佳实践。
每个食谱都包含一个
完整的工作代码示例以及描述该代码的详细文章。这本书是[开源](https://github.com/substrate-developer-hub/recipes)的. 查看[参与指南](https://github.com/substrate-developer-hub/recipes/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md)以大致了解参与的结构和方向。

## How to Use This Book

The easiest place to read this book is at
[https://substrate.dev/recipes](https://substrate.dev/recipes).

The first two chapters are meant to be read in order.

In Chapter 1, [Preparing your Kitchen](./1-prepare-kitchen/index.md), you will set up your
toolchain, compile a blockchain node, and learn to interact with the blockchain.

In Chapter 2, [Appetizers](./2-appetizers/index.md), you will cook your first few recipes, learning
the fundamentals of Substrate development.

The rest of the book, the "Entrees", can be read in any order; skip to whichever recipes interest
you.

Remember, you can't learn to cook by reading alone. As you work through the book, put on your apron,
get out some pots and pans, and practice compiling, testing, and hacking on the recipes. Play with
the code in the kitchen, extract patterns, and apply them to a problem that you want to solve!

## Getting Help

When learning any new skill, you will inevitably get stuck at some point. When you do get stuck you
can seek help in several ways:

-   Ask a question on [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/substrate)
-   Ask a question in the
    [Substrate Technical Riot channel](https://riot.im/app/#/room/#substrate-technical:matrix.org)
-   Open a [new issue](https://github.com/substrate-developer-hub/recipes/issues/new) against this
    repository

## What is Substrate?

[Substrate](https://github.com/paritytech/substrate) is a framework for building blockchains. For a
high level overview, read the following blog posts:

-   [What is Substrate?](https://www.parity.io/what-is-substrate/)
-   [Substrate in a nutshell](https://www.parity.io/substrate-in-a-nutshell/)
-   [A brief summary of everything Substrate and Polkadot](https://www.parity.io/a-brief-summary-of-everything-substrate-polkadot/)

To learn more about Substrate, see the [official documentation](https://substrate.dev).

## Learning Rust

Becoming productive with Substrate requires some familiarity with Rust. Fortunately, the Rust
community is known for comprehensive documentation and tutorials. The most common resource for
initially learning Rust is [The Rust Book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/index.html). To see
examples of popular crate usage patterns,
[Rust by Example](https://doc.rust-lang.org/rust-by-example/index.html) is also convenient.

While knowing some Rust is certainly necessary, it is not wise to delay learning Substrate until you
are a Rust guru. Rather than learning Rust _before_ you learn Substrate, consider learning Rust _as_
you learn Substrate. If you're beyond the fundamentals of Rust, there are lots
[more Rust resources](./more-resources.md) at the end of the book.
