## Logic Proofs <a name = "qed"></a>

Because Substrate grants bare-metal control to developers, certain code patterns can expose panics
at runtime. As mentioned in (2) of [Pallet Development Criteria](#criteria), panics can cause
irreversible storage changes, possibly even bricking the blockchain and rendering it useless.

It is the responsibility of Substrate developers to ensure that the code doesn't panic after storage
changes. In many cases, safety might be independently verified by the developer while writing the
code. To facilitate auditability and better testing, Substrate developers should include a proof in
an `.expect()` call that shows why the code's logic is safe and will not panic. Convention dictates
formatting the call like so

```rust
<Object<T>>::method_call().expect("<proof of safety>; qed");
```

You can find more examples of this pattern in the
[Substrate codebase](https://github.com/paritytech/substrate/search?q=expect). Indeed, including
logic proofs is very important for writing readable, well-maintained code. It comes as no surprise
that this pattern is also discussed in the
[Substrate collectables tutorial](https://shawntabrizi.com/substrate-collectables-workshop/#/3/buying-a-kitty?id=remember-quotverify-first-write-lastquot).

> _QED stands for Quod Erat Demonstrandum which loosely translated means "that which was to be
> demonstrated"_
