# Building a Node

## Prerequisites

Before we can even begin compiling our first blockchain node, we need to have a properly configured
Rust toolchain. There is a convenient script that will set up this toolchain for us, and we can run
it with the following command.

```bash
# Setup Rust and Substrate
curl https://getsubstrate.io -sSf | bash -s -- --fast
```

> This command downloads and executes code from the internet. Give yourself peace-of-mind by
> inspecting the [script's source](https://getsubstrate.io) to confirm it isn't doing anything
> nasty.

### For Windows

These instructions and the rest of the instructions in this chapter assume a unix-like environment
such as Linux, MacOS, or Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL). If you are a Windows user, WSL is the
best way to proceed. If you want or need to work in a native Windows environment, this is possible,
but is not covered in detail here. Please follow along with the
[Getting Started on Windows](https://substrate.dev/docs/en/knowledgebase/getting-started/windows-users)
guide, then return here when you're ready to proceed.

## Compile the Kitchen Node

If you haven't already, `git clone` the recipes repository. We also want to kick-start the node
compilation as it may take about 30 minutes to complete depending on your hardware.

```bash
# Clone the Recipes Repository
git clone https://github.com/substrate-developer-hub/recipes.git
cd recipes

#  Update Rust-Wasm toolchain
./nodes/scripts/init.sh

# Compile the Kitchen Node
# This step takes a while to complete
cargo build --release -p kitchen-node
```

As you work through the recipes, refer back to these instructions each time you wish to re-compile
the node. Over time the commands will become familiar, and you will even modify them to compile
other nodes.

## Checking Your Work

Once the compilation is completed, you can ensure that the node has been built properly by
displaying its help page. Notice that the node executable is found in the `target/release`
directory. This is the default location for Rust projects.

```bash
# Inside `recipes` directory

# Display the Kitchen Node's help page
./target/release/kitchen-node --help
```
