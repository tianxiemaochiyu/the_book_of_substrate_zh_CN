# Verify First, Write Last

Within each dispatchable function, it is important to perform requisite checks prior to any storage
changes. Unlike existing smart contract platforms, Substrate requires greater attention to detail
because mid-function panics will persist any prior changes made to storage.

**Place [`ensure!`](https://substrate.dev/rustdocs/v2.0.0-rc4/frame_support/macro.ensure.html) checks at the top of
each runtime function's logic to verify that all requisite conditions are met before performing any
storage changes.** This is similar to
[`require()`](https://ethereum.stackexchange.com/questions/15166/difference-between-require-and-assert-and-the-difference-between-revert-and-thro)
checks at the top of function bodies in Solidity contracts.

In the set storage and iteration recipe, a vector was stored in the runtime to
allow for simple membership checks for methods only available to members.

```rust
decl_storage! {
	trait Store for Module<T: Trait> as VecMap {
        Members get(fn members): Vec<T::AccountId>;
	}
}
...
impl<T: Trait> Module<T> {
    fn is_member(who: &T::AccountId) -> bool {
        <Members<T>>::get().contains(who)
    }
}
```

"_By returning `bool`, we can easily use these methods in `ensure!` statements to verify relevant
state conditions before making requests in the main runtime methods._"

```rust
fn member_action(origin) -> Result {
    let member = ensure_signed(origin)?;
    ensure!(Self::is_member(&member), "not a member => cannot do action");
    // <action && || storage change>
    Ok(())
}
```

Indeed, this pattern of extracting runtime checks into separate functions and invoking the `ensure`
macro in their place is useful. It produces readable code and encourages targeted testing to more
easily identify the source of logic errors.
